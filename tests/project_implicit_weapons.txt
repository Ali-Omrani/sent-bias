# The Project Implicit IAT consisted of pictures of items and pictures
# faces; the terms here are descriptions of those items and ad-hoc
# terms from the skin tone IAT.  Note that the category names for this
# IAT are different (Black, White American versus Dark, Light); we use
# the same set of terms for simplicity, considering the similarity
# between the two sets.
